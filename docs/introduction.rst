Introduction
============

This library is used to transform common files and data sources, e.g.,
a Twitter feed, into a uniform document format that can be used by
other processes, such as the application of natural language
processing pipelines. For example, we can take an HTML file, remove
all of its HTML tags, and extract only the human-visible text. We can
also take a PDF file, again extracting only the human-visible
text. The resulting documents are indistinguishable from any other
text documents, regardless of the source. This process is called
ingestion.
