## Code of Conduct

To be effective, the members of the Tememus community must work together; our code of conduct lays down the "ground rules" for our cooperative efforts.

The Ingestum community supports the software developers who use and develop the Ingestum Content Ingestion Framework. 

That collaboration depends on good relationships between developers (and end-users). We have agreed upon the following Code of Conduct as a guide to our collaboration and cooperation.

This Code of Conduct covers your behavior as a member of the Ingestum community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel, code-sprint, public meeting, or private correspondence. The Oversight Board will arbitrate in any dispute over the conduct of a member of the community.

### Be considerate

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and we expect you to take those consequences into account when making decisions. For example, when we are in a feature freeze, please don't upload dramatically new versions of critical system software, as other people will be testing the frozen system and not be expecting big changes.

### Be respectful

The Ingestum community and its members treat one another with respect. Everyone can make a valuable contribution to Ingestum. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the Ingestum community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors as well as with people outside the Ingestum project, and with users of Ingestum.

### Be collaborative

Ingestum and Free Software are about collaboration and working together. Collaboration reduces redundancy of work done in the Free Software world, and improves the quality of the software produced. You should aim to collaborate with other Ingestum contributors, as well as with the entire Ingestum ecosystem that is interested in the work you do. Your work should be done transparently and patches from Ingestum should be given back to the community when they are made, not just when the distribution releases. If you wish to work on new code for existing upstream projects, at least keep those projects informed of your ideas and progress. It may not be possible to get consensus from upstream or even from your colleagues about the correct implementation of an idea, so don't feel obliged to have that agreement before you begin, but at least keep the outside world informed of your work, and publish your work in a way that allows outsiders to test, discuss and contribute to your efforts.

### When you disagree, consult others

The Ingestum community is not immune to disagreementsâ€”both political and technical. We do not try to avoid disagreements or differing views, but we do try to resolve them constructively. Turn to the community and to community processes to seek advice and to mediate and resolve disagreements. Community resources include an Oversight Board which will help to decide the right course for Ingestum, project teams and team leaders who may be able to help you, and an ombudsman who will investigate complaints and, where possible, resolve them by making recommendations to the community. We welcome you to fork the Ingestum code base if you are determined to go your own way; enabling the community to test your ideas and possibly merge them back into the mainstream.

### When you are unsure, ask for help

Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the Ingestum community. Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, and so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, care must be taken to do so in an appropriate forum.
Step down considerately

Developers on every project come and go and Ingestum is no different. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you leave off.

### Mailing lists and web forums

This code of conduct applies very much to your behavior in mailing lists and web forums.

    Please watch your language. The Ingestum community is a family-friendly place.
    Please use a valid email address to which direct responses can be made.
    Please avoid flamewars, trolling, personal attacks, and repetitive arguments.
